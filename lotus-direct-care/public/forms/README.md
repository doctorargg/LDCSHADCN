# Patient Forms Directory

This directory contains placeholder references for patient forms. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual PDF files.

## Forms List:
- new-patient-registration.pdf
- medical-history.pdf
- functional-medicine-assessment.pdf
- consent-for-treatment.pdf
- privacy-practices.pdf
- dpc-agreement.pdf
- medication-list.pdf
- records-release.pdf
- symptom-tracker.pdf

Note: These are placeholder files. Actual PDF forms should be created by the medical practice and placed in this directory.
