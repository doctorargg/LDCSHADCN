I'm working on frontend updates for the Lotus Direct Care website. Another CC instance is handling AI/backend integration on the 'ai-integration' branch.

My assignment:
- Work ONLY on the 'frontend-updates' branch
- Focus on frontend files: /components/*, /app/*, /public/*
- Do NOT modify: /lib/ai/*, /api/*, database files, or .env files
- Check CLAUDE_COORDINATION.md for current status
- Commit with descriptive messages like "feat(ui): update hero section"

Please start by:
1. Running 'git checkout frontend-updates'
2. Confirming I'm on the correct branch with 'git branch'
3. Reading CLAUDE_COORDINATION.md for any updates
4. Asking me what frontend improvements I'd like to work on

I'm working in Windsurf IDE alongside another CC instance. Keep changes focused on UI/UX improvements. The other instance is building an AI email response system and blog automation on the backend.

Current project: Lotus Direct Care - a functional medicine practice website built with Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Using shadcn/ui components.
