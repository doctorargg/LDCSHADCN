## 5. Cost Optimization Strategies

### 5.1 Phase Approach
Instead of building everything at once:
1. **Phase 1 ($20,000):** Core website + lead capture
2. **Phase 2 ($15,000):** AI blog system
3. **Phase 3 ($10,000):** Advanced features

### 5.2 Development Options

#### Option A: Freelance Team ($35,000-45,000)
- Frontend Developer
- Backend Developer  
- Project Manager
- **Pros:** Lower cost, flexible
- **Cons:** Coordination challenges

#### Option B: Small Agency ($45,000-65,000)
- Integrated team
- Project management included
- **Pros:** Streamlined process
- **Cons:** Higher cost

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach ($40,000-50,000)
- Agency for core development
- Freelancer for AI system
- **Pros:** Best of both worlds

1. **Use Shadcn UI:** Saves 20-30 hours of UI development
2. **Vercel Hosting:** Cheaper than AWS for this scale
3. **Start with one LLM:** Add others if needed
4. **Manual QA initially:** Automated testing can come later
5. **DIY content review:** Dr. Rosenberg reviews AI content
