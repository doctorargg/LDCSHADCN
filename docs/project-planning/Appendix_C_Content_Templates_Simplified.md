### 5.2 Educational Nurture Sequence (Email 2, Day 3)
```
Subject: The #1 Thing Your Doctor Isn't Telling You

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Have you ever been told your labs are "normal" even though you feel terrible?

You're not imagining things.

Here's the problem: "Normal" lab ranges are based on sick populations, not optimal health. For example:
- TSH "normal" is 0.5-5.0, but optimal is 1.0-2.0
- Vitamin D "normal" is >30, but optimal is 50-70
- B12 "normal" is >200, but optimal is >500

This is why functional medicine uses different ranges – ones based on where healthy people thrive, not just survive.
