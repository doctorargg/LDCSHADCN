**The second best time is now.**

You've got this, Dr. R! In 4-8 weeks, you'll have a professional website generating leads while you sleep, all for less than your monthly coffee budget.

Start building. Start helping more patients. Start today. 🚀

*P.S. - When you get stuck (and you will), remember: Claude Code has seen millions of medical websites. Just describe what you want in plain English, and it will write the code for you. You're not really coding - you're directing an AI that codes for you!*
