Review: I am 52 and Dr. Rosenberg is the best primary care physician I've had the pleasure of working with. I've been a patient for a couple years now and was directed to his office for Suboxone treatment, but it has far surpassed only that. Dr. Rosenberg and staff has literally saved my life and given me another chance at a happy and successful life. I can't thank them enough. I highly recommend Dr. Rosenberg and his staff to anyone struggling with addiction or just looking for a great primary care physician.
