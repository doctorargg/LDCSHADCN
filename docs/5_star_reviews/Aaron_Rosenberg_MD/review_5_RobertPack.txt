Review: Dr. Rosenberg is excellent. Very smart and professional. He has showed true caring and consideration in my two plus years of treatment. He and his staff have been very professional during my treatment. Dr. Rosenberg’s “harm reduction” method of treatment has been effective in my recovery. Dr. Rosenberg is considerate and kind while guiding a patient through the difficult process of recovery. I highly recommend Dr. Rosenberg and his staff.
