Review: I seen Dr. Rosenberg today. As a RN for 14 years, and working with many Doctors over the years, he is beyond exceptional. As a new patient, I felt he listened to everything compassionately/patiently, explained things thoroughly, and truly cared about my medical issues.
Not only was he great, but his staff are too! Brian his medical assistant was so sweet, and Savannah at the front desk was very helpful and patient! I am so blessed to have found this clinic! My son and husband will definitely be going to the Rosenberg now too!
