Review: It is hard to express just how amazingly wonderful Dr Rosenberg and his team Savannah and Brian are.They are wonderfully wonderful! If I can say that.
I came to them a very sick man forced to go to the doctor because my blood pressure was so high(214/120) that I couldn’t get routine dental work done until I saw a doctor and got it down.
Sad afraid and not knowing where to turn I did a google search and Dr Rosenberg’s name came up. I made an appointment and a few days later I was in his office. That day when he saw my blood pressure was so high (190/120) he performed an EKG test on me and did bloodwork.
The EKG showed that my heart was severely enlarged. He immediately set me up with a cardiologist and prescribed me the proper medication. I was also morbidly overweight and he prescribed Zepbound the weight loss medication for me.
Now as you know insurance companies like to collect premiums but don’t like to pay out claims. Initially they refused to cover Zepbound but Dr Rosenberg did not just accept that. He fought for me and did everything he could to help me and in time he found a way and I got the coverage I needed.

Now today;6 months later; after leaving his office my blood pressure is (120/76). My weight is down to 244lbs from 297lbs. I feel so much better and can do things I thought I would never be able to do again(like fit into regular normal sized clothes).My journey is not over but I’m so glad I am not on my journey alone.
Thank you Dr Rosenberg, Savannah, and Brian!! You guys are awesome!!!

With much Gratitude,
