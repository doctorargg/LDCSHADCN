Review Text:
Dr. Rosenberg approaches your care with curiosity and compassion, and goes out of his way to make sure you feel seen, heard, and understood.

He makes it a point to personalize your care plan rather than shoving you into a “standard” box, and listens to your concerns actively, affirms them, and speaks truth, backed by science, to lay out his treatment plan.

Despite being the “expert” in the room, he never speaks condescendingly. He encourages you to advocate for yourself if you don’t understand, or even if you disagree, and he goes out of his way to make sure you grasp the “why” behind the treatment plan.

I’m incredibly grateful to have found this practice and I cannot recommend them enough.
