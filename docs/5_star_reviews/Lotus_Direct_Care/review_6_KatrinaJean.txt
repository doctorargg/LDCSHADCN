Review: I’m so glad I found Dr. Rosenberg. It was really reassuring and useful to have his experience as a PCP in addition to his new functional approach. He found things that no one else did. He cares a lot about the evidence behind treatments, and is very open to discussing options. He’s also just a really nice and caring person. Highly recommended!
