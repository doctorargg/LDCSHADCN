Review: The staff at Lotus Direct Care are top notch!  But more importantly…for the first time (in a long time) my husband and I feel we are also getting top notch health care!  Dr Rosenberg is incredibly knowledgeable and a hands on partner in our care.  At the same time, if he doesn’t know the answer to something, he’s not afraid to say, “Let me look into that”…and he does!  (There is also good follow through with Brian and Savannah!) I love that they all really take the time to learn about what is going on with my health…so I can take better care of myself! (Not like what often happens in a typical setting…where the epic screen drives any conversation…how could it not?  Most doctors have a couple thousand patients!) Dr Rosenberg manages the number of patients he has, so he knows each of us! Thanks Lotus Direct Health!
